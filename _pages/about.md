I am currently a fourth year Computer Science & Engineering and Math major at UCLA. I enjoy all aspects of security, as I am a believer that everything in the world has a need for security. I am currently working on projects with Prof. Rafail Ostrovsky, Prof. Amit Sahai, and the SyssArch lab at UCLA advised by Prof. Nader Sehatbaksh. In a past life, I was an aspiring chemist studying protein-mRNA interactions under Prof. Sean O'Leary at UCR. I have also done research with Sandia National Labs and will be working at Trail of Bits this winter as a security engineer intern.

My current research interests lie in cryptography, from thereotical to applied topics. I am particularly interested in cryptanalysis and different attacks on cryptographic systems. On a similar note, I am also particularly interested in developing secure systems and ways to protect our information from the future.

In my free time, I enjoy playing CTFs with the UCLA team [PBR](https://ctftime.org/team/186494/). I am also an officer of [ACM Cyber at UCLA](https://acmcyber.com) where I work to help spread cybersecurity education at UCLA. I enjoy mentoring others, and have given several talks and lead several projects for members of the club. I am passionate about spreading interest in security.
