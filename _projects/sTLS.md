During one of my research projects, one of the tasks we came across was developing an TLS-in-MPC protocol. Thanks to some previous papers, we had the theoretical foundations laid out but needed to get a working proof of concept. Since we were a team of cryptographers, the hardest part was writing the code and getting it to work. So as a solution to this we decided to just look online for existing implementations of TLS and just modify them, but all of the ones we found online lacked something here or there. After a few weeks I decided to just say screw it and do it myself.

(This is the non-MPC version, that one is still unreleased)
